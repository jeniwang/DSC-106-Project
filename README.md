# Police-Brutality-in-the-US-2013-2019

This project is a presentation of Police Brutality in the US split amongst different races over the course of 2013-2019.

We inspect different races being targetted by police brutality and compare them to their population distribution. More specifically
we wish to show that black lives are being affected the most despite having a relatively low percentage of population. We also compare
the crime rates of a region to how many black lives are being lost.

Here is our prezi on this topic: all charts that it refers to are in this repository.
